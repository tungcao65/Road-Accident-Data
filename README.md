## Overview  
This project explores road accident data using **Microsoft Excel**, identifying trends, risk factors, and key insights to enhance road safety. Through data cleaning, pivot tables, and visualizations, the analysis supports data-driven decision-making.  

## Key Questions  
1. What are the overall trends in **casualties by severity** (fatal, serious, slight)?  
2. How do **accidents vary by month**, and are there seasonal patterns?  
3. Which **road types** have the highest accident rates, and why?  
4. How do **light conditions** (daylight vs. dark) and **road surfaces** (dry, wet, ice) affect casualty numbers?  
5. What vehicle types are involved in most accidents, and do motorcycles or trucks have higher casualty rates?  

## Data  
The dataset includes:  
- **Accident Details**: Date, time, location, severity.  
- **Road Conditions**: Surface type, traffic flow, road type.  
- **Weather Factors**: Visibility, precipitation.  
- **Vehicle Information**: Type, involvement in accidents.  

## Methodology  
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and format data.  
2. **Data Analysis**: Use Excel functions (`SUMIF`, `COUNTIF`, `AVERAGEIF`) to identify trends.  
3. **Pivot Tables & Charts**: Summarize accident frequency by severity, road type, and weather.  
4. **Insights & Recommendations**: Identify high-risk conditions and propose safety improvements.  

## Expected Outcomes  
- **Identification of accident hotspots** and contributing factors.  
- **Visual insights** on trends and risks.  
- **Data-driven recommendations** for road safety improvements.  

### Recommendations  
- Increase **road safety awareness** and driver education in high-risk areas.  
- Implement **better lighting and road maintenance** in accident-prone locations.  
- Improve **signage and traffic control measures** on single carriageways and busy intersections.  
- Monitor weather-related accident patterns to **adjust speed limits and warnings** accordingly.  
- Enhance **vehicle safety measures** and enforcement of driving laws.  

## Tools Used  
- **Microsoft Excel** (Pivot Tables, Charts, and Formulas)
